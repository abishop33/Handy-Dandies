File System Heirarchy Linux : / 	The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
					/bin 	Contains essential command binaries.
					/boot 	Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
					/dev 	Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
					/etc 	Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
					/home 	Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
					/lib 	Shared library files that are required for system boot.
					/media 	External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
					/mnt 	Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
					/opt 	Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
					/root 	The home directory for the root user.
					/sbin 	This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
					/tmp 	The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
					/usr 	Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
					/var 	This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.
